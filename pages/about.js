        <h1>About Me</h1>
        
        <p>Hi there! I’m Lukas, a 21-year old CAD + UX/UI designer originally from Los Angeles, CA.</p>
  
        <p>I am currently enrolled in my fourth year at UCSD as a Cognitive Science major with a specialization in Design and Interaction, and a minor in Speculative Design. Speculative Design focuses creative-based arts, and in conjunction with my Cognitive Science major, I am able to study, further develop, and consider psychological applications within the engineering architecture of any visual product.</p>
  
        <p>I most recently served as a lead for GBCS’ UX/UI and 3D Graphic Design team where I managed multi-weekly team meetings through the complete redesign and launch of the GBCS Group website, collaborating closely with the CEO, VP of Business, and legal and marketing teams. Our redesigned site strengthened our brand identity, boosted user retention, and led to significant growth in business partnerships and donations.</p>
  
        <p>Additionally, we created high-fidelity mockups for the Lokomotive software, enhancing the user interface for B2B fleet management and operational efficiency. Moreover, I worked extremely closely with GBCS' 3D Graphic Design team, where I created, rigged, and texture-mapped character icon GIFs for GBCS’ website and social media platforms through Autodesk Maya.</p>
  
        <p>Outside of my professional career, I firmly believe that "health is wealth." Whether I’m catching waves, crushing gym sessions, or playing pickup basketball runs, staying active is my way of life. And when I’m not pushing my limits, you’ll find me plotting my Yelp and Beli adventures — because life’s too short to not enjoy great eats!</p>
  
        <p>Feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/your-linkedin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> or reach me at <a href="mailto:junnlukas@gmail.com">junnlukas@gmail.com</a>!</p>
